# About | Angular
Angular (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular v2 and above")[4][5] is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
